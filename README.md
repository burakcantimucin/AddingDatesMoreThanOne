# AddingDatesMoreThanOne

A practical application for the booking area with the jQuery framework.

At first, there are TextBoxes created for check-in and check-out dates.

If the user does not fill these two textboxes, an error message will be received via the button to click on to make an extra date selection.

The user will not be able to select a day before the check-in date as the check-out date.

If the user makes more than one choice, the other dates will never conflict with each other.

For example; the first day that can be selected as the second check-in date will be one day after the first check-out date.

In addition, Bootstrap has been used as a CSS library for a better view.
